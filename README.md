# travelin
## a trip planner and nostalgia creator

**Have you ever organized a trip for friends or family? Run into the same set of issues every time?**
- "When do we fly again?"
- "Uh... what should I pack?"
- "Hey, what's the itinerary??"
- "Who's coming along?"

**And your troubles don't end there! As soon as you get home, fresh from your holiday glow and your post-holiday blues, you're bombarded with questions again!**
- "How was your trip?"
- "How long were you gone for?"
- "Can you share your photos?"
- -"Where are your photos, it's been 6 months?! And every time you tell me it's being sorted and organized and whatever..."

**And for those of us with blessed memories,**
- "Uh... I think it was 2016 that I went there, but I don't remember anymore"
- "Hmm... let me see... where did I put those photos"
- "Oh yeah, that was fun but I can't remember exactly where that photo was taken"
- "Was Will on that trip? I can't remember, but I think it was either Will... Or maybe Joe."

Fear no more! With travelin, all your planning and (unplanned future) nostalgia is taken care of. Simply sign up, login, and create your next wild trip with us.

Quickly add your friends and collaboratively add events and notes for each day, and upload photos to associate with each event. We'll automatically extract information from your photo and create a slideshow for you to share. Planning something private? Not to worry - you can create private slideshows! Have some amazing, yet private photos? Hide them from the public slideshow!

Slideshows go through all the public pictures and notes you've created during your trip, plotting your photo location on the map, letting you remember, even years later, all the fun that you had! Travelin' lets you have all the fun, without the headaches!
